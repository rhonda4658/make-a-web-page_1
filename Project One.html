	<h1>Rhonda's notes for Intro to Programming</h1>
<h2> Lesson One   The Basics of the Web and HTML</h2>
	<div class="text">The major pieces of programming are you, your computer browser, the internet, and servers. There are several computer languages, but the purpose of this course is to learn HTML and CSS. 
		<b>HTML</b> is <em>Hypertext Markup Language</em>. 
		HTML is made up of text content, markup, reference to other documents, as well as links and videos. HTML uses tags to create the webpages. There are too many tags to remember them all. An easy way to reasearch the tags is to use <a href="https://www.Google.com"> Google.com</a> The tag used to create the link to Google is an attribute tag. It is necessary to list the entire web address in order for the link to be created.	Some other very popular tags are b to indicate bold text, em to indicate italics, p to create a new paragraph div to create the boxes, and img to add an image to a website. To write code, programmers use text editors. For this project I am using Sublime.</div>
	<h2> Lession Two 	Creating a Structured Document</h2>
	<div class="text">	HTML elements are <b>inline</b> or <b>block</b>. The block elemets create the box design you see on a website if you view the Developer Tools. One of the most common block elements is the div tag. HTML has a treelike structure. It is similar to an outline. The deeper you go into the structure, the more detail is present.</div>
	<h2>Lession Three Adding CSS Style and HTML Structure</h2>
	<div class="text">	CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is one way style is added to a webpage. CSS allows style to be applied easier and it avoids REPETITION. There is less code so less chance for errors to be made. In CSS code elements begin and end with "/*", whereas in HTML they begin and end with "&lt; &gt;". ltalics and normal are the values for font-style in CSS. To bold a font in CSS, font-weight is used. 
		Headings are used to index the contents of a webpage. The lower the number, the larger the font size on the page. Class styles are used when only adding style to certain headings. T
	There are 3 ways to add CSS Styling to a webpage:
			<ul>
			<li class="text">Write CSS in the head of your HTML. This is good for small projects such as the ones used in Scratchpad</li>
			<li class="text">Link your HTML to a separate CSS file.</li>
			<li class="text">Write your style inline with your HTML. This is not recommended because it required a large amount of repeated code.</li>
	<li class="text">With the box model there are 4 basic parts of the box. They are
		<ol>
			
				<li>content</li>
				<li> padding</li>
				<li> border</li>
				<li> margin</li>
			</ol>
		</ul>
		
					 The element width is the found by adding the left border, left padding, content, right padding, and right border together. Box-sizing is a way to create this style. The size can be set as pixels or as a percentage. If it is set as a percentage, the user experience can be better because it adjusts to the size of the screen. 
	</div>
	<h2>	Lesson Four	Final notes</h2>
	<div class="text">One important thing to keep in mind is changing the visual element only changes how it is displayed. It does not change the element itself.
	<h4>When creating a website there are some general guidelines:</h4>
	<ol>
		<li class="text">Get the structure right. Visually boxify it.</li>
		<li class="text">Look for natural boxes of distinct elements.</li>
		<li class="text">Add tags, headings, etc.</li>
		<li class="text">Look for repeated styles and semantic elements.</li>
		<li class="text">Size the boxes</li>
		<li class="text"> Apply Styles from biggest to smallest.</li>
		<li class="text">And lastly, fix things.</li>
	</ol>
	</div>
